Configuration files stored as JSON dictionaries are required for each alignment step. Most of them are automatically created based on user input by the `prep_config*.py` scripts. 

These files are stored in the project root directory, a required argument for `prep_config_xy.py` (project_dir). The following directory structure is created automatically:

```
project_dir
|
└── config
    |
    ├── xy_config                   # Created by prep_config_xy.py
    |       main_config.json        # General information about the project and parameters for XY alignment
    |       xy_STACK_1.json         # Instructions and input paths specific to STACK_1
    |       xy_STACK_2.json
    └── z_config                    # Created by prep_config_z.py
            00_align_plan.json      # General information about the project and parameters for Z alignment
            z_STACK_1.json          # Instructions, parameters, and input path specific to STACK_1
            z_STACK_2.json
            z_STACK_2.json

```

## Configuration for Z alignment (user created)

This dictionary is a required input to `prep_config_z.py`. It contains parameters for flow computations, elastic optimization, and rendering.

*   scale_flow (`float`): value between 0 and 1 specifying the scale at which to compute the downsampled flow fields for estimating local displacement. Lower values are faster but less precise, which can be desirable to account for large structures in the underlying data.

*   flow (`dict`): dictionary of parameters for optical flow computation between consecutive slices:
    *   patch_size (`int`): size in pixels of the cross-correlation window. Larger patches are more robust to noise but reduce spatial resolution of the flow field.
    *   stride (`int`): spacing in pixels between adjacent flow vector estimates. Smaller values produce a denser flow field at the cost of computation time.
    *   max_deviation (`float`): maximum allowed deviation of a flow vector from the local median, in pixels. Vectors exceeding this are treated as outliers and discarded.
    *   max_magnitude (`float`): maximum allowed absolute magnitude of a flow vector, in pixels. Discards vectors from regions with larger displacements.

*   mesh (`dict`): dictionary of parameters for elastic mesh relaxation:
    *   dt (`float`): integration time step. Large values are faster but may cause the solver to overshoot past optimal solutions.
    *   gamma (`float`): viscosity/damping coefficient. Higher values suppress oscillations and improve stability; too high and convergence slows down.
    *   k0 (`float`): spring constant for inter-section springs, connecting mesh nodes between consecutive slices (across Z). Controls how tightly neighboring sections are pulled into alignment with each other.
    *   k (`float`): spring constant for intra-section springs, connecting mesh nodes within the same slice (across XY). Controls the internal rigidity of each section's mesh.
    *   num_iters (`int`): number of time steps to execute at once.
    *   max_iters (`int`): maximum number of iterations, acting as a safety cutoff if the mesh does not converge. Relaxation may stop earlier if `stop_v_max` is reached.
    *   stop_v_max (`float`): convergence threshold — relaxation stops when the maximum vertex velocity drops below this value. Smaller values yield a more converged mesh at the cost of more iterations.
    *   dt_max (`float`): maximum total simulated time allowed for integration, as an additional safety bound.
    *   start_cap (`float`): velocity clipping applied at the start of relaxation. Limits per-iteration displacements to prevent large initial jumps.
    *   final_cap (`float`): velocity clipping applied in later iterations. 
    *   prefer_orig_order (`bool`): if `true`, preserves the original ordering of mesh vertices during relaxation, preventing mesh folding.
    *   remove_drift (`bool`): if `true`, attempts to remove cumulative drift during mesh relaxation. **Note**: in practice this has been observed to introduce drift rather than remove it. Whether that is user error or data specific is unclear.

*   warp (`dict`): dictionary of parameters for applying the displacement map to the image data:
    *   work_size (`int`): tile size in pixels used when processing the image during warping. Larger values are faster but require more memory.
    *   overlap (`int`): overlap in pixels between adjacent work tiles, used to avoid boundary artifacts.
